## Polymorphism
 
-  The dictionary definition of polymorphism refers to a principle in biology in which an organism or species can have many different forms or stages. This principle can also be applied to object-oriented programming and languages like the Java language. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.
   
- The Java virtual machine (JVM) calls the appropriate method for the object that is referred to in each variable. It does not call the method that is defined by the variable's type. (i.e., Java虚拟机(JVM)为每个变量中引用的对象调用适当的方法。它不调用由变量类型定义的方法)

- This behavior is referred to as virtual method invocation and demonstrates an aspect of the important polymorphism features in the Java language.
