- The user enters command-line arguments when invoking the application and specifies them after the name of the class to be run.

- For example, suppose a Java application called Sort sorts lines in a file. To sort the data in a file named friends.txt, a user would enter:
```
java Sort friends.txt

```

- A Java application can accept any number of arguments from the command line. This allows the user to specify configuration information when the application is launched.
